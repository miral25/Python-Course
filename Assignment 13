The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and 
extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and 
the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_422406.xml (Sum ends with 31)

You are to look through all the <comment> tags and find the <count> values sum the numbers. 

To make the code a little simpler, you can use an XPath selector string to look through the 
entire tree of XML for any tag named 'count' with the following line of code:
counts = tree.findall('.//count')

'''
from urllib.request import urlopen
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

url = input('Enter Location: ')
print ("Retrieving " + url)

xml = urlopen(url, ).read()
print ("Retrieved: ", len(xml), " characters")

tree = ET.fromstring(xml)

counts =  tree.findall('.//count')
print ("Count: ", len(counts))

s = 0
for count in counts:
    s = s +  int(count.text)

print ("Sum:", s)
