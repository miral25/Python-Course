'''
The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and 
retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. 
A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.

API End Points
To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data:
http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?

This API uses the same parameter (address) as the Google API. 
This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. 
If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No address..." response.
To call the API, you need to include a key= parameter and provide 
the address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() 
function as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py

Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the place_id and your Python code below. 
Make sure to retreive the data from the URL specified above and not the normal Google API. 
Your program should work with the Google API - but the place_id may not match for this assignment.
